    </h1>
    <p class="textsetting">Welcome to our volunteer sign up form!</p>

    <p class="textsetting">Keep in mind that volunteer opportunities are on a first-come,
             first-serve basis (some events require more volunteers than others), 
             and we will be in touch after you sign up if we need your help. 
             Once you volunteer with us for 3 shifts, 
             you get a complimentary one-year membership with Future Front Texas,
            which includes access to our learning 
            club and all of our most of our events year-round.</p>
        
            <p class="textsetting">Continue reading below and check off the boxes once you've read each of our volunteer agreements.
        Thanks for your support and interest!

            host year-round workshops and meet-ups,

            Everybody and every body are welcome.
            This is about unapologetically supporting the people and places we want to see in the world.
